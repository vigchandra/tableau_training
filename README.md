## Annotated Resources

> There are a lot of open source textbooks already out there on data visualization techniques so we will lean on those heavily for references.

Here are prominent course resources that we will be referring to.

### General data visualization

1. [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/introduction.html)
    - We will be using examples from this textbook throughout the course

1. [Visualization Analysis and Design](https://www-taylorfrancis-com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/books/9780429088902) by Tamara Munzner
   - If visualization topic is near and dear to your heart, you'll want this text
   - Can download the book online through the UBC library
