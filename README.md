# Data Visualization

Effective data visualizations using Tableau

## Course Learning Outcomes

In this course, students will be expected to:

1. Summarize the grammar of graphics and apply them to describe data visualizations
1. Use Tableau to generate data visualizations with common data-types
1. Select the data visualization most appropriate for the the data-type and the communication goal
1. Interpret data visualizations to answer questions and formulate follow-up questions.
1. Describe the steps involved in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and justify its value/role in data science
1. Develop an exploratory data analysis plan for an unknown dataset
1. Justify/Evaluate the value of data visualizations and exploratory data analysis
1. Justify/Evaluate the value of reproducible data visualizations
1. Evaluate data visualizations using effective design principles

### 1. Introduction to data visualization
- Why visualize data? What is story telling?
- Where does viusalization situated in the grand scheme of data science? Can visualization be an end-goal?
- Why is it necessary to enforce best practices in visualization?
- Introduction to data types (Ordinal, Nominal, Quantitative & continuous, discrete, binary, ordered, unordered, datetime, text, etc.)
- Common visualization types (bar, line, points, intervals, geo-spatial, chord, etc.)

### 2. Connecting to data sources
- Introduction to data enegineering and needs
- Connecting to csv, excel (differences)
- Connecting to SQL Server
- Relationships between data sources
- Managing metadata, live vs. extract
- Saving and publishing data sources
- Join types (left, right, inner, outer)
- Connecting to other data sources

### 3. Creating data visualization
- Dimensions
- measures
- Drill down
- Heirarchies
- Sorting
- grouping
- sets, filters, slicing
- formatting
- Tool tips
- trend lines
- reference lines
- forecasting, clustering

### 4. Principles of Effective Visualizations & Choosing an appropriate visualization
- What should you absolutely not do?
- Common pitfalls (8-10 examples)
- Choice of visualization (bar vs. line vs. pie vs ....): When do we use what?

### 5. Exploratory data analysis
- Why are EDAs important?
- Developing the 6 types of staatistical questions (exploratory, descriptive, inferential {frequentist, bayesian}, causal, mechanistic, predictive)
- How to approach an EDA? (Exercise)
- Conclusion and next steps in an EDA



## Resources

> There are a lot of open source textbooks already out there on data visualization techniques so we will lean on those heavily for references.

Here are prominent course resources that we will be referring to.

### General data visualization

1. [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/introduction.html)
    - We will be using examples from this textbook throughout the course

1. [Visualization Analysis and Design](https://www-taylorfrancis-com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/books/9780429088902) by Tamara Munzner
   - If visualization topic is near and dear to your heart, you'll want this text
   - Can download the book online through the UBC library
